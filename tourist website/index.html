      <h2><u>History of jharkhand</u></h2>
      <p>The central government formed a committee on the Jharkhand matter in 1989. It stressed the need for greater
        allocation of development funds for the area. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill
        area of Assam. Other tribal areas were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and Santal
        Pargana development boards were constituted under the chairmanship of the then chief minister of Bihar under the
        provision of the fifth schedule in 1972. This failed to achieve the desired result. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha
        wanted more representation and the All Jharkhand Students Union was against it. Due to differences these parties
        broke away from each other. The All Jharkhand Students Union introduced elements of violence in the movement and
        called for a boycott of election while Jharkhand Mukti Morcha opposed this. The Jharkhand Area Autonomous
        Council bill passed in Bihar's legislative assembly in December 1994. The Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council were
        given responsibility for forty areas including agriculture, rural health, public work, public health and
        minerals. The council has power to recommend legislation to the Assembly through the state government and to
        frame bylaws and regulations.</p>

      <p>In 1998, when the separate state movement was falling apart, Justice Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo was leading the
        movement. In 1998, the Union government decided to send the bill concerning the formation of the state of
        Jharkhand to the Bihar Legislative Assembly to which Lalu Prasad Yadav had said that the state would be divided
        over his dead body. A total of 16 political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, Jharkhand Mukti
        Morcha, the All Jharkhand Students Union, and the Congress came in one platform and formed the 'All Party
        Separate State Formation Committee' to start the movement. Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee.
        Voting on the Jharkhand Act was to be done on 21 September 1998 in Bihar legislation. On that day the committee,
        under the leadership of Shahdeo called for Jharkhand Bandh and organized a protest march. Thousands of
        supporters of a separate state took to the streets led by Shahdeo. He was arrested and detained in a police
        station for hours along with many supporters.</p>
