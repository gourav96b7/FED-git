          width="100%" />
        <article>Located near the Taimara village in the Ranchi district, Dasham Falls, also known as Dassam Falls, is a
          spectacular waterfall in the state of Jharkhand which is a tributary of the Subarnarekha River. Cascading down
          a height of 144 ft., the waterfall boast of utter serenity, peace and calm. The area surrounding the spot is
          engulfed in rich greenery, that makes it an ideal picnic place in the region. To reach the spot, you will have
          to climb a flight of stairs. You can also stop in between and stare at the gorgeous scenery surrounding
          it.<br>
          The waterfall is basically a Nick Point, also known as Knick Point, which means that it has been developed
          over the years due to the break in the rocky slopes in a longitudinal manner. For the same reason, it is not
          ideal to swim or to step into the water as the current is strong and the ground is uneven. Other than that,
          the region echoes with the gurgling sound of water which is like music to the ears, and is perfect to relax
          and rejuvenate.</article>
